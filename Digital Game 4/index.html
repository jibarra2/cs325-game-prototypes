<h2>Chicken Farm</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What's original about my game is that I've taken the code from the game snake and I've changed the assets so that they are now centered around the theme of chickens. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I wanted to do more with the technicals for the mechanics just didn't really know how to impliment it.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
From this prototype the hardest thing was getting my assets to show up on screen. So far everything I've gotten in my code is correct and is in the right places, it just won't show up for some reason. I'm learning a lot more javascript or at least I'm understanding the idea behind certain things I still don't know how to code much of it.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made all the assets myself, the chicken is mine and the food can is original as well.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Snake is the game that I've modeled my game after and I've used the phaser code for their Snake game.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Run around as a single chicken collecting food so you can multiply and have your own army of chickens!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the "Chicken" card
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
For the input we're taking it from the keyboard. We've also got a lot of randomness. For play styles I had collector selected. In terms of genres I would say this is an overhead game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I would say this prototype is trying to evaluate the wrap around mechanic where if you go off the edge of the screen, you show up on the other side.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to just have fun with the game. I've always loved the simplicity of Snake so I thought reinventing it a bit would be cool.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
In the game the player has the basic mechanics of moving up, down, left, and right. As you move around the screen you collect food for your chicken to grow the size of the chicken army. But you don't want to have the army collapse in on itself because then you'll have to start ove again!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The best strategies with the game is to create a long an spacious path when you have a good amount of chickens in your army so that you don't have to worry about hitting yourself to get another piece of food.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
In this world, chickens are starting to become more intellegent so they want to create their own little chicken army to free themselves from the farm they're kept in. They've found a way to clone themselves using the food their Farmer gives them. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who likes Snake, or chickens is really my target audience.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
However long you can survive.
