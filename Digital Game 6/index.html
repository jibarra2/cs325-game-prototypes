<h2>Mad Twister!(The update)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What’s original about my game is that instead of playing to save the characters from the twister, you are playing as the twister trying to destroy houses.
P.S. I know right now you can't pickup anything, I couldn't get the overlap physics to work but I do plan on fixing that in the next game.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Right now for me what is intersting is the tile mapping for this game. It gives you so much more space to work with and makes the game just feel less confined.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
With this prototype I really learned how to analyze javascript more and different things that I can do with it. All things that give me ideas for the next iteration of the game.
So far the hardest thing was to get the overlap physics to work. I also had originally intended to make a breakout game but for some reason the code for Phaser example 
oneline doesn't seem to work for me so I decided I would make the next best thing that I could.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All of these assets I either borrowed from somewhere or added onto it.
<ul>
<li>Wilson the Twister: <a href="http://pngimg.com/download/35951">Tornado</a></li>
<li>Grass background: <a href="https://www.naylorlandscape.com/5-steps-lush-lawn/">Grass</a></li>
<li>Kia car: <a href="http://pngimg.com/download/34380">Kia</a></li>
<li>Mailbox: <a href="http://pngimg.com/download/43031">You've got Mail</a></li>
<li>House #1: <a href="http://pngimg.com/download/24590">House #1</a></li>
<li>House #2: <a href="http://pngimg.com/download/24587">House #2</a></li>
<li>Bed: <a href="http://pngimg.com/download/17381">Where the magic happens</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
For this game I just used the tilemap example from the phaser folder.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Destroy the city tons at a time as the world's biggest twister rolls through the midwest.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
For input I used mouse, for randomness I used deterministic, for playstyles I used collector (or tried to), and for genre I chose overhead 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is really evauluating the movement of the tornado. I was trying to get the prototype to a point where it would evaluate the collision/overlap physics as well.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the players to have fun and really try their best to get a good streak going with how many things they can collect. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
To play the player must use their mouse to move the tornado around the field. I've tried to impliment a core mechanic of collecting an item that is on the field but I couldn't get the code right. But in the next iteration of the game I do plan on having that as a core mechanic of the game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Once I've gotten the code right so that the tornado can collect the different items, I think a good strategy would be to try and keep your
mouse movements very short so that you have the most control over the tornado.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
One cool summer night in Montana, the town of Tribesville is sleeping peacefully. But all of a sudden sirens are going off to warn the townspeople that the biggest twister known to man is headed for their small quaint town. 
Meanwhile, Wilson the Twister is on a cross country road trip by himself exploring all the land has to offer. 
The only thing is that Wilson is the clumsiest twister ever always just throwing stuff around by accident and bumping into stuff.
He’s really just a kind twister that’s trying to get through this town but everyone is making him seem like a monster.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
For anyone who’s into tornados or destruction games, you’ll have a great time!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It shouldn't take long at all to play my game once I actually can get the objects to dissapear when the tornado overlaps them.
For now you can really play forever until you get bored really.
